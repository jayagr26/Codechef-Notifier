## Extension Service workers (service workers)

Extension service workers are an extension's central event handler.
Extension service workers vs Web service workers

Commons with web service workers
An extension service worker is loaded when it is needed, and unloaded when it goes dormant

Difference with web service workers
Extension service workers are installed and updated differently from web service workers.

Note: In some contexts here and around the web you will see service workers called "background scripts". Previously, this site often used the terms interchangeably. Manifest V2 also included a feature called a background script. To avoid overloading the term and creating confusion, this section will use "extension service worker" or "service worker" throughout.
